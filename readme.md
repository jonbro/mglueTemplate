A minimal template for making an mglue game.

Clone this repo, then run `npm install` to get setup.

The game is in `client_src/glueGame.ts` - currently this has a bunch of junk in it. You can rename this to whatever you want, just change the filename, and the matching line in `webpack.config.js`

This project includes two scripts to make life easier:
- `npm run watch` Runs a development server that auto refreshes on code changes at localhost:8080
- `npm run build` Generates the project in the `public` folder
